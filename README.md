An app to automate text preparation from HTML to typeset pages

This will be an attempt to build a small web app to automate the initial steps described in [this bookbinding how-to guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11JyVxeRS8yEWgCYrNMUPlNrEbR5AAD3Z2aDP-QXEP3Y/edit#) by [ArmoredSuperHeavy](https://twitter.com/ArmoredHeavy), taking HTML output from [Ao3](https://archiveofourown.org) and making it friendlier to typeset. Scope may expand, but that's the first goal!
